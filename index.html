            <p>Labburn is a port of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn for Emacs theme</a>, which in turn is
                is a direct port of the popular <a href="http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/">Zenburn</a> theme for vim,
                developed by <a href="https://github.com/jnurmine">Jani Nurminen</a>.</p>

            <p>The main change is the movement of color defintions to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space">Lab Color Space</a>,
                which allows better manipulation and comparative equality in perception of the lightness of different colors. Colors were converted from the zenburn theme and slightly adjusted in lightness.
                All/most bold attributes were removed as well, as these change the lightness perception. Developtment of the original zenburn theme is tracked as far as appropiate, last <em>merged</em> commit was <em>3112683</em>.</p>

            <p>The theme is made to be used with the rainbow-identifiers package, please enable this.</p>
